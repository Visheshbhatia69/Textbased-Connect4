# Textbased-Connect4
Text-based Connect 4 game built in Python(7X6 grid)

# Description
Connect Four is a two‑player strategy game played on a 7×6 grid. Players take turns dropping discs into columns, and the disc occupies the lowest available position. The objective is to connect four of your own pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.



# Project Structure (as of LAST PUSH)

```
connect4/
├── README.md
└── tbconnect4.py   # no added as its empty as of now
```


# How to Run (working on the steps)

Once the game is implemented, it can be ran using:

```
python tbconnect4.py
```

# Requirements (to be completed over coming days)

This project will eventually include:

* A working text‑based Connect Four game with user input
* Correctness checks (valid moves, win detection, error handling)
* Ability to store and export game data
* Code comments and documentation
* Regular Git commits showing development progress

**Note:** Advanced features (AI agents, GUI, optimisation) are optional and may be added later if desired.

---

## Next Steps (planned for upcoming days)

* Implement board representation
* Implement move validation and piece dropping
* Implement win and tie detection
* Add export functionality
* Add tests and correctness assertions
